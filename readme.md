# GUI Directory Tree Explorer ‚ú®

A simple yet powerful desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that generates a clean, tree-style representation of a directory's structure. It includes file-type specific icons (emojis) and a one-click "copy to clipboard" feature, making it easy to document and share your project's layout.

You can easily customize the application's behavior by editing the configuration variables at the top of the `.py` file.

-   **Change Icons:** Add or modify file extension icons in the `FILE_ICONS` dictionary.
    ```python
    FILE_ICONS = {
        '.py': 'üêç', '.js': 'üìú', '.html': 'üåê', # ... and so on
    }
    ```

-   **Ignore More Directories:** Add new folder names to the `IGNORE_DIRS` set.
    ```python
    IGNORE_DIRS = {'.git', 'node_modules', 'venv', '__pycache__', 'dist'}
    ```

-   **Adjust Scan Depth:** Change the `MAX_DEPTH` value to scan more or fewer levels deep.
    ```python
    MAX_DEPTH = 3 # e.g., change to 4 to go one level deeper
    ```
